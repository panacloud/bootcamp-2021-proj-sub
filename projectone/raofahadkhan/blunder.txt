I have did a really big mistake I didn't read your post sir and build the whole project and the time I completed
and pushed to my repo on github I got to know that I have to work on your forked repo so I have copied all the 
files in this repo the way you said and if you want to see the original project and wana see the logs of it so 
this is the link https://github.com/raofahadkhan/todo-console-and-persistent-data-app-in-typeScript-.git

sorry for that big blunder and please consider my project
