# Bootcamp 2021 Project Submitions 

This repository is for submitting projects for [Bootcamp 2021](https://panacloud.github.io/bootcamp-2021/). We will use the [Using the Fork-and-Branch Git Workflow](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/) to submit projects. In order to submit a project you will take the following steps:


1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repo.
2. Clone the forked repo to your local system.
3. Add a Git remote for the original repository.
4. Create a branch with your own name in the forked repo to place your projects.
5. Create a subdirectory in the project directory with your name as the project directory name. For example I will create a project directory named ziakhan as a subdirectory of projectone.
6. Do your coding for the project in projectone/your.name
7. Commit the changes to your branch.
8. Push the branch to Github.
9. Open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) from the new branch to the original repo.
