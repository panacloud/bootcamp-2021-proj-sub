# Project 2

I have already made a todo cli using typescript and ocliff as my first project, here is the link to it <a href="https://github.com/ShaharyarAhmed-bot/bootcamp-2021-proj-sub/tree/shaharyar_ahmed/project_1/shaharyar_ahmed/todocli">link</a>

Therefore the only thing I have to do is to publish my command line app to the npm registry! Here is the link to the published package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shaharyarahmed/tdcli">link</a>
